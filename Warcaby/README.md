This project was made in C++ console and it handle mouseEvents.

From simple change of global constant you can change board size.

## Code source
All interesting source code you find [here](https://github.com/Wid-mo/Portfolio/blob/master/Warcaby/main.cpp)

## Note
This program may work in a weird way because it was intended to pass a C ++ course to be displayed on old monitors.
If console doesn't react on click then change settings in console window properties.
